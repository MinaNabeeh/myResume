    \item RTE integration and create requested port interfaces across sw component teams and functional safety teams using Davinci configurator and Developer and between BSW.
        \item contributing in safety CDDs and creating runnables like SMU alarms, real time measurements and  watchdog supervised entities configurations and helped in maintaining project stability with new timing requirements.
        \item CANoe DBC integration and testing and updating canoe scripts to validate and test.
        \item implement new BSW requirements like OS Task configuration and splitting and create OS spinlocks along with memory mapping and linker scripts changes.
                \item write necessary SW requirements on polarion SRD,SAD,SDD and perform required SQTS and SITS.
                \item Create Runnables with Events mapped to Swcs and adapted new customer requirements into OS architecture.
                    \item BSWM mode handling and BSWM rules changes ownership along with BSW integration
                    \item perform unit test using vector CAST tool
                \\
                
\\{\bf Denso ECU} -Arm cortex A\\

    \item implement AUTOSAR wrapper for CAN driver requirements and  optimizations.
      \item provide necessary MCAL configurations ports,CAN and LIN configuration using MCAL EB Tresos Studio.
    \\
        
\\{\bf Robotic Swarm Algorithm-Graduation Project}\\
implement swarm intelligent algorithm performed on a set of robots to execute realtime tasks the robots were implemented using Atmega32, my particular role was implementing odometry algorithm and interfacing sensors like proximity and line tracker sensor that was used to detect the angle of rotation of the robots to make the robots able to identify it's position.
